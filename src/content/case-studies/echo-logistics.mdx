## The Challenge

Echo Logistics manages a fleet of 4,000 trucks and 50+ warehouses. Their legacy optimization software ran batch processes once every 24 hours. The world doesn't wait 24 hours.

Unexpected traffic, weather events, or driver call-outs would render morning plans obsolete by noon, leading to inefficient "empty miles" and missed SLAs.

## The Approach

We built a **Digital Twin** simulated environment and trained Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to manage the network dynamically.

### 1. The Simulation
We modeled their entire physical operations in a high-fidelity Rust-based simulation. This allowed us to train agents on "10 years" of logistics scenarios in just 2 days of compute time.

### 2. Multi-Agent RL
Each region was controlled by a localized agent that optimized for local efficiency while communicating with neighboring agents to ensure global coherence (e.g., handing off loads).

### 3. Continuous Deployment
The system now re-optimizes the entire fleet every 15 minutes, ingesting traffic API data and warehouse IoT sensor streams.

## The Results

- **Efficiency:** Reduced empty miles by 18%, directly improving bottom-line margins.
- **Reliability:** On-time delivery rate rose from 82% to 94%.
- **Sustainability:** Route optimization led to a 34% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
