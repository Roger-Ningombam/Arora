## The Challenge

Nebula SaaS, a leading fintech platform handling over $5B in annual transaction volume, was facing a critical "leaky bucket" problem. Their legacy churn prediction system was rule-based, static, and only flagged risky accounts after they had already disengaged. 

The existing system had a **high false positive rate (35%)**, causing their success team to waste hours chasing happy customers while high-value at-risk accounts churned silently.

## The Approach

We re-architected their entire retention pipeline around a custom Transformer-based model rather than generic regression.

### 1. Data Unification
We built a real-time feature store ingesting behavioral signals (login frequency, feature usage), financial signals (billing failures, seat reductions), and support signals (ticket sentiment).

### 2. Temporal Modeling
Unlike snapshot models, our architecture analyzes *sequences* of user actions. A user logging in 5 times a day might be healthy, or they might be frantically trying to export data before cancelling. Context is everything.

### 3. Intervention Engine
Prediction is useless without action. We connected the inference engine directly to their CRM (HubSpot) and Intercom. 

## The Results

The system was deployed in shadow mode for 2 weeks, then fully rolled out.

- **Precision:** Increased from 45% to 94.2%
- **Revenue Impact:** Prevented an estimated $4.2M in annualized churn in Q1
- **Operational Efficiency:** Support team reduced "check-in" volume by 60%, focusing only on high-provision signals.
