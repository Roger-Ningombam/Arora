## The Challenge

Vanguard Health operated a network of 12 independent research hospitals. They wanted to train a unified computer vision model to detect early-stage anomalies in MRI scans.

However, **data privacy (HIPAA/GDPR) made centralization impossible.** They could not move patient data to a central cloud server for training.

## The Approach

We implemented a **Federated Learning (FL)** architecture. Instead of moving data to the model, we moved the model to the data.

### 1. Edge Training
We deployed local training nodes within each hospital's secure on-premise data center. These nodes trained on local data and only shared encrypted weight updates—never raw patient data—with the central aggregator.

### 2. Differential Privacy
To prevent reverse-engineering of patient faces from model weights, we applied Differential Privacy (DP) noise injection mechanisms, ensuring mathematical guarantees of anonymity.

### 3. Asynchronous Aggregation
Since hospital networks are unreliable, we built a custom asynchronous aggregation protocol that allowed the global model to converge even if 30% of nodes were offline or suffering high latency.

## The Results

- **Scale:** Successfully trained on 1.2M scans across 12 isolated facilities without a single byte of PHI leaving the premise.
- **Diagnostic Performance:** Achieved F1-score of 0.92 on anomaly detection, surpassing human radiologist benchmarks (0.86).
- **Compliance:** Full regulatory sign-off from 3 separate IRB boards.
